# REPORT


# Introduction

The miniproject is developed in C Programming Language. We will be going over how we planned on implementing a TicTacToe game using C Programming Language and Run in Visual Studio Code using Github and a as many various other tools as we could testing or deployment.

# About The Project:

1. The game has a basic interface that runs in the terminal.

2. The goals of this project are:

 a. Practice with C Programming Language using Visual Studio Code.

 b. Learn how to structure, Correct use of logic and interface files to keep code maintainable.

 c. Practice of Github and Github creating branches for the different features.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:-

 SWOT Analysis is a simple tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best right now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also reveal areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.

 a) Strengths:

    Tic Tac Toe is in itself a wonderful game for developing planning skills as children need to plan out how they can build their own line of 4 while also watching out for what their opponent is doing so they can block their opponent from winning

 b) Weaknesses:

    Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your projects, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures.

 c) Opportunity:

    They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future.

 d) Threats:

   The theft of intellectual property is one of the primary concerns for online gaming companies.

        1.Data Breaches.
